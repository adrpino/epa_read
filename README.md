# epa_read
Simple R function that reads fixed width data from the "Encuesta de Poblaci√≥n Activa" (EPA)

The microdata of the EPA survey are published as fixed width data, in which each observation is just a row of numbers,
not human readable.

This functions splits this data on columns and saves it to a more usable .csv file.
